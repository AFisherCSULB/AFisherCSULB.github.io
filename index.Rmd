I am an Associate Professor of Botany and Curator of the Herbarium (LOB) at California State University, Long Beach (https://www.csulb.edu). I teach upper-level Botany courses in the Department of Biological Sciences (BIOL427, BIOL439). Students in my research lab work on plant evolution questions using molecular and morphological data. I am particularly interested in systematics and estimating the plant tree of life. Some of my students work on floristics- the study of plant diversity in a particular place.  

I graduated from the [University of Iowa](https://clas.uiowa.edu/envsci/) with a BS in Environmental Sciences in 2004. In 2005 I began a PhD in Biology with Dr. Scot Kelchner at [Idaho State University](https://www.isu.edu/bios/), working on the systematics of the neotropical bamboo genus *Chusquea*.  In 2011 I moved to Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont, California to work on chloridoid grass systematics with Dr. Travis Columbus. In 2013 I began working with Dr. Lucinda McDade on the systematics of several Acanthaceae genera. I am particularly interested in macro-evolutionary patterns of pollinator shifts and effects on floral morphology. 

I am currently looking for MS students to research plant evolution. Please contact me if you are interested in joining the lab!
