The CSULB Herbarium holds approximately 17,700 specimens. The collection is largely from Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside Counties. Our oldest specimens were collected in the early 1950s. 

We are currently in the process of databasing the collection in the NANSH Symbiota Portal (http://nansh.org/portal/). Within the next year we hope to add these records to the Consortium of California Herbaria. The herbarium received NSF funding for digitization in July, 2018.
